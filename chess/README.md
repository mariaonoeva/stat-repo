# Chess data and stat 

Hi, this part of the repo is dedicated to chess, welcome! So far I store here my Puzzle Rush progress.

## Puzzle rush
Puzzle Rush is a puzzle solving mode on `chess.com` where one has to solve as many chess puzzles as possible up to three mistakes. There are three time controlsâ€”3 mins, 5 mins and no time. I enjoy this mode very much and play it a lot. My current record (16.05.2025) for 3 mins is 25 puzzles and I want to improve. 

The initial idea was to simply scrap my data from `chess.com` API, but it's unfortunately not enough for me. So I created two Jupyter files to track my progress.  

1. **[Puzzle rush progress for the current month](puzzle-rush/puzzle_rush.ipynb):** a script that takes an input from the command line, adds it to a csv and then creates a plot for the current month. 
2. **[Total puzzle rush stat:](puzzle-rush/total_stat_puzzle_rush.ipynb)** some basic descriptive stat for the whole journey.
