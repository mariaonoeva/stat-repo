My statistics repository 

Hi, this is my repository dedicated to statistics. I post here my R scripts and various statistical stuff. 

Materials: 
- I like this web about statistics https://www.crumplab.com/statistics/ 
- This looks interesting but I haven't check it yet https://vasishth.github.io/bayescogsci/book/
- I often peek to "How to do Linguistics with R: Data exploration and statistical analysis" by Natalia Levshina
- This also looks good https://learningstatisticswithr.com/
