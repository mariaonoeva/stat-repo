My freq stat notebook for naturalness/acceptability judgment -- [HERE](freq/script.md)

Materials: 
- I like this web about statistics https://www.crumplab.com/statistics/ 
- This looks interesting but I haven't check it yet https://vasishth.github.io/bayescogsci/book/
- I often peek to "How to do Linguistics with R: Data exploration and statistical analysis" by Natalia Levshina
- This also looks good https://learningstatisticswithr.com/
