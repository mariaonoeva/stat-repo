**All as for freq script but using Bayes**

Hi! This R notebook describes the steps that are required for the
analysis of naturalness/acceptability judgment linguistic experiments. I
use the experiment that I did with Radek Šimík testing Russian negated
polar questions in different contexts as the example data (see [Onoeva
and Šimík
2023](https://mariaonoeva.github.io/assets/pdf/FDSL16_RuNPQs_Onoeva_Simik.pdf)).
We had several sub-experiments, here I report on one because code is the
same for all of them. The experiment was run on
[LRex](https://www.l-rex.de/).
